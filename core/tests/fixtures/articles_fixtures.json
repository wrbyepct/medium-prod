      "body": "## Kent Beck's Code Simplification Process\n\n1. Make it work\n2. Make it right\n3. Make it fast\n\nMost developers start at step 3. But premature optimization kills clarity. You can't optimize what you don't understand, and you can't understand what doesn't work yet.\n\n### The Three Steps Explained\n\n**Step 1: Make it work** - Get a working solution, even if it's ugly. Prove the concept works.\n\n**Step 2: Make it right** - Refactor for clarity, maintainability, and correctness. Clean up the mess.\n\n**Step 3: Make it fast** - Only now should you optimize. Profile first, then optimize the bottlenecks.\n\n### Why This Order Matters\n\nPremature optimization is the root of all evil. You can't optimize what you don't understand, and you can't understand what doesn't work yet. Working code that's slow can be profiled and optimized. Perfect code that doesn't work is worthless.",

Great designers subtract. Start with everything, then remove until you can't remove anymore without losing function.\n\n### Application in Software\n\nThis applies to UI/UX design perfectly:\n- Remove every button, field, and option\n- Add back only what users actually need\n- Remove decorative elements that don't serve function\n- What remains is the essence\n\n### The Result\n\nProducts that are timeless, intuitive, and last decades.

First drafts are supposed to be terrible. That's not failure, that's process.\n\n### The Pixar Story Process\n\nEvery Pixar movie's first version is bad. Not mediocre. Bad.\n\nToy Story's first cut was so bad they almost shut down the project. But that's expected.\n\n### Why Ugly First Drafts Work\n\n- Perfectionism paralyzes\n- Shipping ugly v1 breaks the paralysis\n- Feedback only works on real work, not ideas\n- Iteration compounds\n\n### The Braintrust\n\nPixar's secret weapon: Regular feedback sessions where:\n- Anyone can criticize anything\n- No ego protection\n- Problem identification, not solution prescription\n- Truth over politeness\n\n### Embracing Failure\n\nFailure isn't the opposite of success. It's part of the process.\n\nIf you're not failing, you're not trying hard enough.",

Going from 1 to n is incremental. Going from 0 to 1 is innovation.\n\n### The Contrarian Question\n\n\"What important truth do very few people agree with you on?\"\n\nThis is the foundation of innovation. Consensus is already priced in.\n\n### Competition is for Losers\n\nThiel's controversial take: Competition destroys profits.\n\n- Perfect competition → zero profit\n- Monopoly → sustainable profit\n- Google has a search monopoly → massively profitable\n- Restaurants compete fiercely → most fail\n\n### Going from 0 to 1\n\n**0 to 1:** Creating something new that never existed\n**1 to n:** Copying what works (globalization)\n\n### How to Create 0 to 1\n\n1.

Calculate the cost of inaction\n\nWe overestimate risks and underestimate our ability to recover. Fear dissipates when examined.\n\n### Why Goal-Setting Fails\n\nSetting goals sounds nice but often paralyzes:\n- \"What if I fail?\"\n- \"What if it doesn't work?\"\n- \"What if I lose everything?\"\n\nFear keeps us stuck.\n\n### Fear-Setting Instead\n\n**Step 1: Define worst case**\nWhat's the absolute worst that could happen?\n\n**Step 2: Prevent**\nWhat could you do to prevent this?\n\n**Step 3: Repair**\nIf it did happen, how would you recover?\n\n**Step 4: Benefits**\nWhat are the benefits of attempting this?\n\n**Step 5: Cost of inaction**\nWhat will your life look like in 6 months, 1 year, 3 years if you do nothing?\n\n### The Key Insight\n\nOnce you realize:\n- Worst case isn't that bad\n- You can prevent most of it\n- You can recover from the rest\n- Cost of inaction is higher\n\nFear dissipates.",
